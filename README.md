# tic-tac-toe

In this project, we build a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

## Setup Installation

                                            gem install win32console  # For Windows only

## Game Rules

- It is a two player game
- One player uses X and the other player uses O to mark their positions on the board
- Positions can be marked vertically, diagonally, and horizontally.
- The player that places three of their marks in a row is the winner
- If none of the players are able to get 3 marks in a row and all the moves on the 3 by 3 board are used, the game is a draw.
